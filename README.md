# EasyKV

If you need to generate .KV files for your CS:GO maps, I have good news for you! This tool does exactly that!
This is not an open source project. While it was coded in Python, you don't need to install it separately because it is compiled for better compatibility.

There are 2 versions: A portable and one which you can install on your computer.

# How to use
1. Download the repository
2. Unzip the easykv.zip file
3. Open the unzipped folder
4. Start the program by clicking easykv.exe
5. You can place this folder in a location it won't be removed
6. Now you can place a shortcut on your desktop
7. Enjoy

# Compatibility
Windows 7 - Not tested
Windows 8.1 - Should be compatible
Windows 10 - Compatible
Windows 11 - Not tested yet - should work without any issues as no major under the hood changes were made (which would affect the program)

At the moment other operating systems are not supported.
